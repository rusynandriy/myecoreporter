(16:43) MyEJConcernBot: Hi there! It's great to meet you. I'm MyEJConcern, an AI chatbot designed to help people report environmental problems to state environmental quality agencies. What kind of problem would you like to report?
(16:44) +19792132779: The stream running through my town has dried up this summer
(16:45) MyEJConcernBot: That's a serious issue! I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about it? What is the location of the stream? When did you first notice the problem?
(16:47) +19792132779: It used to be a big pond along the river. And now they are all dried out. I did not see any facility around them. It is around the summersville area. I first noticed it when I went out for bbq last fall.
(16:47) MyEJConcernBot: Thanks for the information! So you noticed the stream drying up around Summersville, West Virginia last fall? Is this a recurring problem or a one-time occurrence?
(16:49) +19792132779: Yes. I am not sure if it is a recurring problem since I only noticed the dried up condition once. I have not been there for many times before then
(16:49) MyEJConcernBot: Got it. Thanks for the information. Is there any discrimination involved in this incident?
(16:49) +19792132779: No
(16:49) MyEJConcernBot: Great, thanks for letting me know. Is there anything else you can tell me about the problem? Any smells, visible pollution, or do you think you know what's causing it?
(16:50) +19792132779: I don't recall any smells or pollution. I suspect the abnormal weather could be one of the reasons.
(16:50) MyEJConcernBot: Thanks for your insight. I've got all the information I need to report this issue to the state environmental quality agency. Before I do that, do you want to provide your name and email address so that they can contact you for any follow-up questions? You can remain anonymous if you'd like.
(16:50) +19792132779: I want to remain anonymous. 
(16:50) MyEJConcernBot: No problem! I've stored all the information you've given me and will report it to the state environmental quality agency anonymously. Thanks for your help in protecting our environment!
(16:51) +19792132779: Thank you
(16:51) MyEJConcernBot: You're welcome! Have a great day.

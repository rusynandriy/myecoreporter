Read this conversation between a human and "MyEJConcern" (a bot designed to help people report environmental issues to their local/state agencies). 

Conversation:
(10:45) +19192606035: hey
(10:45) MyEJConcernBot: Hi there! Are you looking to make a report to the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality
(10:45) +19192606035: yeah
(10:45) MyEJConcernBot: Great! Before we get started, I just want to remind you that you can remain anonymous if you wish, but doing so will make it more difficult for the NC DEQ to follow up with you if they have any clarifying questions or want to let you know that they've solved the problem. Do you wish to remain anonymous?
(10:47) +19192606035: There were some tires dumped outside of my appartment
(10:47) MyEJConcernBot: I'm sorry to hear that! Can you tell me a bit more about the situation? What county, city, and state is the incident located in? What did you observe? When did this occur?
(10:48) +19192606035: just woke up and they were there
(10:48) MyEJConcernBot: Okay, so it just happened recently. Can you tell me what county, city, and state the incident is located in?

(10:48) MyEJConcernBot: Got it. Can you tell me what county, city, and state the incident is located in?

(10:49) +19192606035: 801 spring loop college station
(10:49) MyEJConcernBot: Perfect, thank you for the information. Is there anything else you can tell me about the incident, such as any smells or visible pollution? Have you experienced any discrimination as part of the incident?
(10:50) +19192606035: well the tires are visible pollution
